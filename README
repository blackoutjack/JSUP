JSUP - JavaScript UPdater

Created by Rich Joiner (rich@richjoiner.com) in collaboration with Raja Bala (meetraja@cs.wisc.edu) under the guidance of Professor Ben Liblit at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Science department.

=========== GETTING STARTED ============
The following instructions describe how to checkout the repository and execute an example usage of JSUP.

1) This project depends on ANTLR v3. It can be obtained as a single .jar file from http://www.antlr.org/download.html. Download the file antlr-3.x-complete.jar. As of 12/19/2010, the direct URL for this file is http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.3-complete.jar. (ANTLRWorks is not needed.)

2) Add the .jar file to your Java classpath. To do this, append the environment variable CLASSPATH with the absolute path for the file. 

3) Grab the JSUP repository with the following command, replacing [username].

	git clone git@github.com:[username]/JSUP.git ./JSUP

4) Change directories to ./JSUP and run make.

5) If successful, the bin/ subdirectory is created containing the compiled .class file tree. You can change directories to bin/ (or alternatively, add the bin/ directory to your classpath) and run the following command to test the installation.

	java com.blackoutjack.jsup.JSUP ../subjects/test.html ../patches/test.jsup
